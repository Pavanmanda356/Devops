The error message you're encountering:

Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
\302\226ggit@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
This error message indicates that you're having trouble authenticating with GitHub using an SSH key. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to solve it:

Understanding the Error

Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts. This message is normal. It means that your computer doesn't recognize GitHub's SSH key and is adding it to the list of trusted keys so that future connections to GitHub aren't intercepted.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey). This is the core of the problem. It means that when Git tried to connect to GitHub using SSH, GitHub rejected the connection because it didn't recognize the public key provided by your computer.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository. This is a consequence of the authentication failure. Git can't access the repository because it couldn't authenticate.
Reasons for the Error

No SSH Key Configured: You haven't generated an SSH key pair on your computer.
SSH Key Not Added to GitHub: You've generated an SSH key pair, but you haven't added the public key to your GitHub account.
Wrong SSH Key: You're using a different SSH key than the one you added to your GitHub account.
SSH Agent Not Running: The SSH agent, which holds your private key, isn't running, so Git can't access it.
Incorrect Permissions: The permissions on your private key file are too open.
